# KNN_Example
You are given hw2train.csv as your training data and hw2test.csv as your test data.

Load these datasets.

Use different k values (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 21, ...) to train kNN classifiers.

For each k value, find the classification accuracy on train and test data.

Display training and test classification accuracy values in a plot (x axis will show k, y axis will show two plots which are training and test accuracies).

Determine best k.

Train on training data using best k and display the kNN performance on training and test data.
